    - Thanks to Adadov:
       - Adjusted parsing to work with newer OSX :: rt 48059 (applied patch from https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Attachment/636368/324402/)
       - removed note 'It doesn't handle "SPLogsDataType" well at all so its a basically useless type unless you do it via $pro->xml() :)' since the patch appears to have addressed it!
